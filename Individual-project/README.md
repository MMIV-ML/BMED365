# Individual project BMED365

According to the course plan [BMED365](https://www4.uib.no/en/courses/BMED365) the second block of the course will focus on computational biomedical imaging (MRI, IMC, ...) and modelling. Between the first and second block, _the students will work on their own individual project, defined by the student henself within the scope of the course_. This presentation of the individual project must be submitted before the end of block two and will be presented to the rest of the students as a "speed posters". 

### Guidelines for the Individual project


1. Pick a topic from the BMED 365 curriculum (incorporating a **computational imaging**, **computational modeling** or an **AI** component) that fits your research interests or evokes your curiosity. The topic could be your own research project, a scientific article, a review of methods with pros and cons, etc. (you can ask for advice regarding topic selection or your planned talk in the early preparation phase).

2. Prepare a presentation of the topic [make the title yourself] as if you should give a speed-talk / speed-poster  at a scientific meeting with a very motivated audience - but who might not be experts in your field.   

3. For this purpose make a Google Slides (or PowerPoint, or Keynote, or Beamer) _presentation of 7 min duration_ and plan for a _3 min discussion_ with your audience  (student peers and possibly others). The "poster" itself is not expected to be a made, but rather a presentation of the topic. 

4. You might also write a short manuscript or notes telling what to say during the presentation, but avoid reading directly from your manuscript during the talk as the notes are meant for rehearsal only.

5. The presentation produced in 3. must be sent/shared on Discord at latest 2 hours before the session starts.<br>  


6. For the evaluation of the presentation, **the following criteria are assessed**:
_scientific attitude_, _vocabulary_, and _balanced use of text, tables, and figures_; _clarity in presentation_ regarding problem formulation / introduction, methods description, results (if any), discussion, and conclusions; ability to bring enthusiasm for your topic to the audience; keeping time.
Remember to share your presentation with your peers before the "speed-poster" session starts (see 5.).<br>

**The Individual project with "speed-poster" presentation is a compulsory assignment for the course**   


**Note**: In addition to the Individual project, there will be a final digital home [exam](../Exam/README.md) in Inspera (2 hours) with MCQs and essay questions (with a pass / fail grading)
